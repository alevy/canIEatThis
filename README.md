A chrome extension that analyzes recipe ingredients to determine whether or not they should be left out according to your diet specifications.

Because my stomach is stupid and can't do the one job assigned to it, and as a result my diet is a bit restrictive.

###I got really tired of spending more time looking up ingredients in recipes than actually making the recipes.

So I made a extension that does the analyzing for me.

###To Do:
*Format so that only food words are shown
*Enable the user to customize which diet they are following
